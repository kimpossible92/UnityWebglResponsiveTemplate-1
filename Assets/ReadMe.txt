2D Level Editor for Unity

This package allows the user to add a simple 2D Level Editor to their game. 
The 2D Level Editor allows users to create levels intuitively and fast while also allowing players to create and share their own levels.

Features:

- Add and remove prefabs to quickly and simply build a level
- Allow player to create and share their own levels
- Use different layers to create depth
- Show all layers or only the current layer
- Save and load the levels 
- Grid overlay to visualize the future tile placement
- Test and change at run-time for quick iterations
